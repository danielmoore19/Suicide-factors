# Suicide-factors
A look into the available statistics from a kaggle on suicide rates.

This one (3rd capstone) was quite personal for me as my sister took her own life in 2018. Interestingly, she doesn't fall into any of the high risk categories. So it was quite difficult, and yet strangely acted as a focusing agent, to report that the best ways we can fight suicide is alleviating the poverty of the eldely. They are far and away the most at-risk, and under-reported in the news. I completely expected the numbers to skew towards teenagers and twenty-somethings.
